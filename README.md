# C++ Example: VRS Viewer 

This is an example that shows how to use [Rerun](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun)'s C++ API to log and view VRS files.

## Installing the Rerun viewer
The Rerun C++ SDK works by connecting to an awaiting Rerun Viewer over TCP.

#### Building from source
* [Install `cargo`](https://rustup.rs/)
* `cargo install rerun-cli`

#### Using `pip`
* `pip install rerun-sdk`

### Running the Rerun viewer
Just type `rerun` and the rerun viewer should show up. Then it is time to run this example!


## How to build and run

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
